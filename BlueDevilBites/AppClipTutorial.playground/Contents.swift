// Code Example: Basic structure of an App Clip in Swift

import UIKit
import AppClip

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // Setup your App Clip's initial view controller here
        self.window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)
        let mainViewController = UIViewController()
        mainViewController.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.white
        self.window?.rootViewController = mainViewController
        self.window?.makeKeyAndVisible()
        return true
    }
}

/*:
The above code demonstrates a simple structure of an App Clip in Swift. The `AppDelegate` class is the entry point for the App Clip, setting up the initial view controller.

Now, let's look at a simple use case implementation for an App Clip.
*/

// Code Example: A use case implementation for an App Clip

import CoreLocation

class ParkingAppClipDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // Setup your Parking App Clip's initial view controller here
        self.window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)
        let mainViewController = ParkingViewController()
        self.window?.rootViewController = mainViewController
        self.window?.makeKeyAndVisible()
        return true
    }
}

class ParkingViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        view.backgroundColor = .white
        // Additional setup for your parking App Clip
    }
}

/*:
Let's look at a SwiftUI implementation for an App Clip.
*/
import SwiftUI

//struct ParkingAppClip: App {
//    var body: some Scene {
//        WindowGroup {
//            ContentView()
//        }
//    }
//}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Welcome to the Parking App Clip!")
            .font(.title)
            .padding()
        // Additional UI components and logic for your parking App Clip
    }

            .font(.title)
            .padding()
    }
}

/*:
#### 2. Integrating with the main app.
Ensure that your App Clip shares the same bundle identifier as your main app but with `.clip` as a suffix.
*/

// Code to illustrate the concept (this is usually set in the project settings, not in code)
let mainBundleIdentifier = "com.example.myapp"
let appClipBundleIdentifier = "\(mainBundleIdentifier).clip"
print("Main App Bundle Identifier: \(mainBundleIdentifier)")
print("App Clip Bundle Identifier: \(appClipBundleIdentifier)")

/*:
### C. Advanced Features and Techniques

#### 1. Implementing location-based services.
Use CoreLocation to add location-based services to your App Clip.
*/

// Example code for using CoreLocation in an App Clip (simplified for illustration)
import CoreLocation

let locationManager = CLLocationManager()
locationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()

/*:
#### 2. Leveraging Apple Pay and Sign In with Apple.
Integrate Apple Pay and Sign In with Apple for a seamless user experience.
*/

// Pseudo code to demonstrate integration points
func integrateApplePay() {
    print("Apple Pay integrated successfully.")
}
